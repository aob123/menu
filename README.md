## Menu

This is a work in progress. The idea behind the site is to create a collection of menus of the restaurants in my home town, purely as a source of inspiration for those who wish to go to a restaurant for dinner / lunch. There will be no functionality to make orders but there will be contact information to the restaurants official websites.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
