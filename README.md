# Menu

This is a work in progress. The idea behind the site is to create a collection of menus of the restaurants in my home town, purely as a source of inspiration for those who wish to go to a restaurant for dinner / lunch. There will be no functionality to make orders but there will be contact information to the restaurants official websites.

## Prototype

note: There is also an idea to make another version but listings for gigs and such, the ideas can be viewd in the link above.
